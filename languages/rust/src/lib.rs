//! Reference Rust SDK. An integrator (integrator, app, or service) depends on this
//! crate, never on `avalon-server` or `avalon-chain` directly — see
//! `docs/stakeholders/Proposal.md` §17 and `docs/architecture/sdk.md`.
//!
//! Every public item is documented (issue #49) — `#![deny(missing_docs)]`
//! below enforces that mechanically rather than by convention alone. See
//! `docs/developers/` for task-oriented guides (`getting-started.md`,
//! `achievements.md`, `capabilities.md`, `guilds-and-friends.md`,
//! `errors-and-retries.md`, `local-development.md`) and `rust/examples/`
//! for runnable, `make check`-compiled examples; this rustdoc is the
//! reference, not a tutorial.
//!
//! `authenticate()` is wired to a real `avalon-server`: `GET /me` for
//! identity/profile, `GET /me/grants` (issue #27) for this integrator's own
//! active capability grants for the authenticating identity, identified via
//! `AvalonConfig::integrator_credential_key_id`. `AvalonClient::login()` (issue
//! #398, see `device_login`) is the other way to end up with a `Session`,
//! for a client with no WebAuthn surface of its own — it wraps #307's
//! cross-device pairing and resolves to the same `Session` `authenticate()`
//! does. Achievements (issue #34, see
//! `achievements`) and friends/presence (issue #17, see `social`) and
//! guild membership/roster/channels/chat (issue #23, see `guilds`) are all
//! wired to live endpoints rather than stubbed. `sync_journal` (issue #110)
//! is the local durable-storage half of offline participation described in
//! `docs/architecture/synchronization.md`; `submission` (issue #111) is the
//! drain/retry/reconciliation half. Neither is wired into `AvalonClient`'s
//! or `Session`'s other methods yet — no method appends to the journal on
//! its own. An integrator constructs a `FileJournal` and `SubmissionEngine`
//! itself and drives them explicitly; `Session::submission_transport`
//! supplies the `Transport` the engine submits through. `network` (issue
//! #482) is the SDK-side counterpart to the Hub's STH-based network
//! pinning (`docs/architecture/network-trust-anchors.md`) —
//! `AvalonClient::verify_network` independently verifies which network a
//! server actually is before an integrator registers an issuer or submits
//! a write, since `network_id` alone carries no cryptographic authority.
//! `issuer_registration` (issue #483) is the first caller of that check:
//! `AvalonClient::register_issuer` requires an explicit declared
//! `network::TargetNetwork` and refuses, client-side, to register against
//! anything else — belt-and-suspenders alongside the server's own
//! `declared_network_id` gate (#481).
//!
//! `account` (issue #699, on top of #696/#697/#698) is a second, entirely
//! separate session type: `AccountSession`, a first-party client for an
//! identity's own account (registration, login, recovery, passkeys,
//! devices, full guild administration, and every other action
//! `packages/api-client` exposes to Hub) — obtained via
//! `AvalonClient::register`/`account_login`/`resume_account_session`, never
//! via `authenticate()`. There is no conversion between `Session` and
//! `AccountSession` in either direction, by design: an integrator
//! credential must never yield account-level power. Every action #697
//! flags as signature-required signs itself automatically with
//! `AccountSession`'s own locally-held Ed25519 key.
